r1-->flag{sup3r_s3cr3t_k3y_1337}

binary file so,used ida free or ghidra and got the c program and decoded it.


r2-->flag{compiled_python??}


i found the flag for 2nd reversing. Decompiled the pyc file and got a python code then used this function to get the flag:



def two(input_str):

    modified_str = ''
    
    for i in range(len(input_str)):
    
        char = input_str[i]
        
        if i % 2 == 0:
        
            modified_str += chr(ord(char) + 3)
            
            continue
            
        modified_str += chr(ord(char) - 2)
        
    return modified_str
    
print(two("cn^ixelomkigaam{qjlp<Az"))




r3-->flag{at_least_this_cafe_wont_leak_your_credit_card_numbers}
