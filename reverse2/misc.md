1)first i changed the hexadecimal code to text and i got this:
xdv r5yg drvg 0oL xDwA gY5R ZsC gYjN ZsQ jIlM aWdX kOp 1wA KoP YgJn

2)then i noticed some common words in which some are reversed
in challenge hint its given to see the file type which is txt which is a  palindrome
and i got words like:
--->r5yg gy5r
--->awdx xdwa

3)in challenge description its given "special keyboard"
i saw my keyboard
5r,yg,wa,dx------ are in diagonal
